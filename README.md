# Molecular Dynamics Simulation with OpenMM For Beginners

Welcome to the Molecular Dynamics Simulation Beginner Tutorial! This repository is designed to help you kickstart your journey into the fascinating world of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. With an easy-to-follow Jupyter notebook provided in this repository, you'll learn the basics of setting up, and running MD simulations for a protein-small molecule complex using OpenMM a versatile and powerful library for molecular simulations.

## Features

- **Introduction to Molecular Dynamics:** Understand the fundamental concepts behind MD simulations.
- **Environment Setup:** Instructions for setting up a Python environment with all the necessary libraries, including OpenMM.
- **Simulation Workflow:** A step-by-step guide to preparing your system, choosing parameters, running simulations, and basic analysis.
- **Interactive Examples:** Experiment with pre-defined simulation setups to see the effects of different parameters.
- **Analysis Tools:** Learn how to analyze your simulation results, including evaluating structural stability and dynamic properties.

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to have Python installed on your system along with Jupyter notebooks. The notebook is designed to run in Google Colab, which provides a free cloud-based environment, allowing you to follow along without any local setup. However, instructions are also provided for setting up and running the simulations on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
- OpenMM & OpenFF library

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or open it directly in Google Colab using the link provided.
2. If running locally, create a Python virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv mdenv
   source mdenv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

- Open the Jupyter notebook `OpenMM-MDSimulation.ipynb` in Jupyter or Google Colab.
- Follow the instructions within the notebook to run the simulations and perform analysis.
- Feel free to modify parameters and experiment with different systems to explore the capabilities of molecular dynamics simulations.
